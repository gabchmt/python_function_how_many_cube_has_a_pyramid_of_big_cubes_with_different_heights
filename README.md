# python_function_how_many_cube_has_a_pyramid_of_big_cubes_with_different_heights
## This python function can calculate for you how many cubes has a pyramid composed with big cubes with different heights.


pyramid(1,11,2,3)  #LIKE IN THE IMAGE BELOW


the first cube is 1x1x1, the second is 3x3x3, the third is 5x5x5 etc.. till 11x11x11 
( so firstCube = 1 ; lastcube = 11 ; step = 2 and its a 3d cube [if its 2d : 11x11] so dimensionsNumber = 3 )
